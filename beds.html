            <b>Spring onion</b> is a hardy herb with a mild oniony taste. A memeber of the allium family, just like 
            garlic, leek, and onion, you can repeatedly trim off what you need for cooking from a spring onion plant
            and it will continue to grow, providing it is looked after. They require full sun, and fertile soil, so 
            be sure to use plenty of compost or well-rotted manure. They are ready to eat within a few weeks, unlike 
            other alliums.

            <b>Silver beet</b> is a delicious green leafy vegetable that holds its shape well in soups. It requires a spot 
            with full sun and well-drained soil. It is quite hardy and frost tolerant, and can be grown almost year-round 
            in many parts of Australia including central Gippsland.
        </p>
        <p class="text center hide large" id="front_text">
           <b>Beetroot</b> is a bright red root vegetable sometimes used in dyes. It is more forgiving than the leafy 
           vegetables and can handle part shade as well as full sun. It does need a well drained, fertile soil though. Don't 
           plant where the soil is too heavy or compacted or it won't be able to form nice roots. It grows better from seed 
           because, like most root vegetables, it doesn't tolerate being transplanted very well. It is sweetest and tastiest
           if it grows quickly, so keeping your beetroots well fed is important - use well rotted manure and seeweed, and nothing 
           too high in nitrogen.
