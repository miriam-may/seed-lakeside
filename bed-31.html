            <b>Chives</b> is a hardy herb with a mild oniony taste. A memeber of the allium family, just like 
            garlic, leek, and onion, you can repeatedly trim off what you need for cooking from a chives plant
            and it will continue to grow, providing it is looked after. They require full sun, and fertile soil, so 
            be sure to use plenty of compost or well-rotted manure. They are ready to eat within a few weeks, unlike 
            other alliums.

            <b>Silver beet</b> is a delicious green leafy vegetable that holds its shape well in soups. It requires a spot 
            with full sun and well-drained soil. It is quite hardy and frost tolerant, and can be grown almost year-round 
            in many parts of Australia including central Gippsland.

           <b>Kale</b> is a dark green vegetable high in antioxidents. Like many green leafy vegetables, nitrogenis important to 
           form healthy leaves. It is also a very shallow-rooted plant, so is vulnerable to changes in temperature and moisture close to the 
           surface of the soil. For this reason, water regularly and consider using pea straw or a similar mulch to keep the soil a 
           regular temperature. Kale plants can get rather big, so space out your seeds or seedlings well, allowing at least 35cm 
           between each plant.
