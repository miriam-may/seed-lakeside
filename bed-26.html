            <b>Rainbow chard</b> is an easy plant to grow, and will grow in part shade as well as full sun, which is less common for leafy green vegetables.
            Rainbow chard tolerates both frosts and heat, so is a nice hardy vegetable to have in the garden. They should produce food for two seasons before
            they start to die, then just pull them out and replant. They like regular watering and a fair amount of nitrogen in the soil.

        <p class="text center hide large" id="lettuce_text">
            <b>Lettuce</b> is one we've all been hearing about since the recent high prices! It is also a very easy plant to grow. It grows quickly in well-drained soil, and 
            will be sweeter if well-watered. Make sure the soil drains well. Lettuce will appreciate some shade during the warmer months to stop it from scorching. Loose-leaf 
            varieties are better for the warmer months as varieties that form heads (such as Iceberg) tend to bolt to seed as soon as there is some heat and sun, so keep 
            those varieties for winter crops.
