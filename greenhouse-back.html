        <p class="text center hide large" id="basil-text">Basil is a sweet, aniseed-y herb and a kitchen favourite in many dishes. It tends to bolt and go to seed very easily
            in warm weather, so can be a challenge. Try snipping off any flower buds as they form to delay them bolting.
            They like warm tempartures and full sun in Gippsland. In really hot climates, they may require some protection but not in the south of Victoria. 
            Basil is also an excellent companion plant for tomatoes.</p>
        <p class="text center hide large" id="zucchini-text">Zucchini is a versatile vegetable that is also extremely easy to grow. Too easy, some might say - if 
            you don't keep the zucchini plants under control, they can take over and the zucchini fruit can get extremely big, so be watchful and pick them early!
        They do like warm soil, so are a spring/summer plant. Start in punnets or sow direct into warm, moist soil. The flowers are also edible. </p>
