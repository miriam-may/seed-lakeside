# Seed Lakeside Commmunity Garden educational idea

The idea is a simple website where people can explore the beds and greenhouse at Seed, being able to click on the different plants and see information on what they are, how they are used, and how to grow them at home. I'm really just lacking some current photos of the Garden so I can create the finished product.

## About the project

Seed Lakeside Community Garden is a not-for-profit garden in Sale, Victoria. I am the IT volunteer there. I offered to create this page, mainly for children's activities, as something "different" for the garden.

It uses HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript to create a static website. No backend required, no personal details saved and tracked in cookies.
