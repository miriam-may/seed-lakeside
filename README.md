# Seed Lakesise Commmunity Garden educatoinal idea

The idea is a simple website where people can explore the beds and greenhouse at Seed, being able to click on the different plants and see information on what they are, how they are used, and how to grow them at home. It uses HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. I'm really just lacking some current photos of the Garden so I can create the finished product.
